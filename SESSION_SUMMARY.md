# MCP Server Setup Session Summary

## Date: 2025-06-28

## What We Accomplished

### 1. üîê 1Password Integration
- Configured two vaults: **AI** and **Server-Configurations**
- Implemented secure secrets management with TypeScript
- Created providers for Environment variables and 1Password CLI
- All secrets use the `notesPlain` field pattern
- Added caching with 5-minute TTL for performance

### 2. ü§ñ MCP Servers Implemented
- **GitHub Server**: 40+ tools, authenticated with token from AI vault
- **Filesystem Server**: 15+ tools, sandboxed to `/Users/spencer/repos`
- **Memory Server**: 10+ tools for knowledge persistence
- **Docker Server**: 20+ tools for container management

### 3. üöÄ Claude Integration
- Claude Desktop configured with MCP servers
- GitHub token automatically pulled from 1Password
- Filesystem access properly sandboxed
- Ready for AI-assisted development

### 4. üìÅ Project Structure
- TypeScript-based implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Security-first design with vault restrictions
- Modular architecture for easy extension

## Key Files Created

- `/src/secrets/` - Complete secrets management system
- `/docs/guides/secrets-management.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `/scripts/setup-claude-desktop.sh` - Auto-configuration for Claude
- `/examples/secrets/` - Demo scripts for testing

## Your Configuration

```bash
# Vaults
AI Vault: GitHub Token, AI ML API settings
Server-Configurations: Redis, Email, Logging configs

# Verified Working
‚úÖ GitHub API access (user: slcc2c)
‚úÖ 1Password CLI integration
‚úÖ Secret resolution from both vaults
‚úÖ Claude Desktop configuration
```

## Security Features

1. No plain text secrets in code or configs
2. Vault access restricted to AI and Server-Configurations only
3. Automatic secret rotation support
4. Audit logging capability
5. Path sandboxing for filesystem operations

## Next Steps

1. Add more API keys as needed (OpenAI, Anthropic)
2. Start using with Claude for development tasks
3. Extend with additional MCP servers as needed
