# üìã MCP Server Development Tasks

## üéØ Project Status
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server ecosystem provides comprehensive tooling for AI-collaborative development. This document tracks development tasks and priorities.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Implement all Tier 1 servers (GitHub, filesystem, Docker, memory)
- [x] Implement all Tier 2 servers (PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j, Kubernetes)
- [x] Implement Tier 3 servers (Jupyter)
- [x] Create gateway server with routing and authentication
- [x] Set up 1Password integration for secure secrets
- [x] Configure multi-client authentication (Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, OpenAI)
- [x] Create auto-start configuration for macOS (launchd)
- [x] Configure Fish shell environment variables
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation suite

### Phase 2: Real-time Communication
- [x] **Implement WebSocket support** for bidirectional communication
  - Created `/src/gateway/websocket.ts` with full client management
  - Message-based protocol with typed messages
  - Real-time tool execution capability
  - Client authentication and session management
  
- [x] **Add Server-Sent Events (SSE)** endpoint
  - Streaming endpoint at `/api/v1/events`
  - Heartbeat mechanism for connection management
  - Standard EventSource compatibility

- [x] **Test real-time features**
  - Created `test-websocket.js` for validation
  - Documented protocol in `/docs/real-time-communication.md`
  - Verified gateway integration

### Phase 3: Bug Fixes and Improvements
- [x] **Fix authentication rate limiting issue** (#70) - 2025-06-28
  - Moved rate limiter initialization from request handler to app startup
  - Fixed in `/src/gateway/auth.ts` by creating rate limiters during initialization
  - Health endpoint now accessible without authentication
  - API endpoints properly authenticated with client-specific rate limiting

### Phase 4: TypeScript Fixes
- [x] **Fix TypeScript build errors** (#61) - 2025-06-29
  - Fixed 400+ TypeScript errors across all servers and core modules
  - Key fixes:
    - Added type annotations to all `createToolHandler` calls
    - Fixed Docker API type compatibility issues  
    - Resolved Express route handler return types
    - Fixed unused variable warnings
    - Corrected implicit any types throughout codebase
  - Build now completes successfully with 0 errors

## üöß In Progress Tasks

*Currently no tasks in progress*

- [ ] Plugin architecture for custom MCP servers
- [ ] Multi-region deployment support
- [ ] Advanced logging and monitoring with OpenTelemetry

### Developer Experience
- [ ] VS Code extension for MCP development
- [ ] Interactive documentation with live examples
- [ ] MCP server generator/scaffolding tool
- [ ] Performance profiling tools

### Workshop Enhancements
- [ ] Workshop scenario templates
- [ ] Interactive tutorials
- [ ] Progress tracking for learners
- [ ] Collaborative workshop features

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **External Server Integration**
   - GitHub server shows stderr output on stdio
   - Filesystem server shows stderr output on stdio
   - Non-blocking but creates log noise

## üìä Task Priorities

### Critical Path (Single User Focus)
1. Create comprehensive test coverage
2. Enhance core server capabilities
3. Improve error handling and resilience

### Non-Critical (Deferred)
- OAuth 2.0 implementation (not needed for single user)
- Multi-user workshop features
- Advanced deployment configurations

## üîÑ Task Management

Tasks are tracked using the TodoWrite/TodoRead tools during development sessions. This file serves as a persistent record and high-level overview.

### Adding New Tasks
When identifying new tasks:
1. Add to appropriate priority section
2. Include task ID if tracked in todo system
3. Provide clear description and context
4. Link to relevant files/issues

### Updating Progress
- Move completed tasks to "Completed" section with date
- Update "In Progress" section actively
- Review priorities weekly

## üìà Progress Metrics
