# XcodeBuildMCP Setup Complete! âœ…

The XcodeBuildMCP server has been successfully installed and configured for your Claude Desktop.

## What was done:

1. **Cloned XcodeBuildMCP** from the official repository
   - Location: `/Users/spencer/repos/mcp-server/external/XcodeBuildMCP/external/XcodeBuildMCP/`
   - Built successfully with all dependencies

2. **Updated Claude Desktop Configuration**
   - File: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Added xcodebuild server pointing to the built XcodeBuildMCP

## To use XcodeBuildMCP:

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** (required for changes to take effect)

2. **Available tools will include:**
   - `xcodebuild_build` - Build Xcode projects
   - `xcodebuild_test` - Run tests
   - `xcodebuild_list_schemes` - List available schemes
   - `xcodebuild_list_simulators` - List iOS simulators
   - `xcodebuild_boot_simulator` - Boot a simulator
   - `xcodebuild_install_app` - Install app on simulator/device
   - `xcodebuild_launch_app` - Launch app on simulator/device
   - And many more...

## Example Usage in Claude:

After restarting Claude Desktop, you can:

```
List all available iOS simulators
```

```
Build my iOS project at /path/to/project using the "MyApp" scheme
```

```
Run tests for my Swift package
```

## Troubleshooting:

If tools don't appear after restart:
1. Check Claude Desktop logs: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/logs/`
2. Verify the server is accessible: `node /Users/spencer/repos/mcp-server/external/XcodeBuildMCP/external/XcodeBuildMCP/build/index.js --help`
3. Ensure Xcode is installed: `xcodebuild -version`
